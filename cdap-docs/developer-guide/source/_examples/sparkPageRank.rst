SparkPageRank Application Example
---------------------------------

A Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) Example Demonstrating Spark

Overview
........

This example demonstrates a Spark application performing streaming log analysis, computing the page rank based on
information about backlink URLs.

Data from a sample file is sent to CDAP by the external script *inject-data*
to the *backlinkURLStream*. This data is processed by the
``BackLinkFlow``, which stores the URL pair event in its entirety in *backlinkURLs*, an ObjectStore Dataset.

As these entries are created, they are taken up by the *SparkPageRankProgram*, which
goes through the entries, calculates page rank and tabulates results in another ObjectStore Dataset, *ranks*.

Once the application completes, you can query the *ranks* Dataset by using the ``rank`` method of the *RanksProcedure*.
It will send back a JSON-formatted result with page rank based on the ``url`` parameter.

Let's look at some of these elements, and then run the Application and see the results.

The SparkPageRank Application
.............................

As in the other `examples <index.html>`__, the components
of the Application are tied together by the class ``SparkPageRankApp``::

  public class SparkPageRankApp extends AbstractApplication {

    public static final Charset UTF8 = Charset.forName("UTF-8");

    @Override
    public void configure() {
      setName("SparkPageRank");
      setDescription("Spark page rank app");

      // Ingest data into the Application via a Stream
      addStream(new Stream("backlinkURLStream"));

      // Process URL pairs in real-time using a Flow
      addFlow(new BackLinkFlow());

      // Run a Spark program on the acquired data
      addSpark(new SparkPageRankSpecification());

      // Query the processed data using a Procedure
      addProcedure(new RanksProcedure());

      // Store input and processed data in ObjectStore Datasets
      try {
        ObjectStores.createObjectStore(getConfigurer(), "backlinkURLs", String.class);
        ObjectStores.createObjectStore(getConfigurer(), "ranks", Double.class);
      } catch (UnsupportedTypeException e) {
        // This exception is thrown by ObjectStore if its parameter type cannot be
        // (de)serialized (for example, if it is an interface and not a class, then there is
        // no auto-magic way deserialize an object.) In this case that will not happen
        // because String and Double are actual classes.
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
      }
    }
  }

``backlinkURLs`` and ``ranks``: ObjectStore Data Storage
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The raw URL pair data is stored in an ObjectStore Dataset, *backlinkURLs*.
The calculated page rank data is stored in a second ObjectStore Dataset, *ranks*.

``RanksProcedure``: Procedure
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This procedure has a ``rank`` method to obtain the page rank of a given URL.

Deploy and start the application as described in  :ref:`Building and Running Applications <convention>`

Running the Example
+++++++++++++++++++

Injecting URL Pairs
###################

Run this script to inject URL pairs
to the Stream named *backlinkURLStream* in the ``SparkPageRank`` application::

	$ ./bin/inject-data.sh

On Windows::

	~SDK> bin\inject-data.bat

Running the Spark Program
#########################

There are three ways to start the Spark program:

1. Click on the ``SparkPageRankProgram`` in the Application page of the CDAP Console to get to the
   Spark dialogue, then click the *Start* button.

2. Send a query via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command::

     curl -v -d '{args="3"}' \
    	  -X POST 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/SparkPageRank/spark/SparkPageRankProgram/start'

   On Windows, the copy of ``curl`` is located in the ``libexec`` directory of the SDK::

     libexec\curl...

3. Use the command::

    $ ./bin/app-manager.sh --action run

  On Windows::

    ~SDK> bin\app-manager.bat run

Querying the Results
####################

If the Procedure has not already been started, you start it either through the 
CDAP Console or via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command::

	curl -v -X POST 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/SparkPageRank/procedures/RanksProcedure/start'
	
There are two ways to query the *ranks* ObjectStore through the ``RanksProcedure`` procedure:

1. Send a query via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command. For example::

	 curl -v -d '{"url": "http://example.com/page1"}' \
	  -X POST 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/SparkPageRank/procedures/RanksProcedure/methods/rank'

   On Windows, the copy of ``curl`` is located in the ``libexec`` directory of the SDK::

	  libexec\curl...

2. Type a Procedure method name, in this case ``RanksProcedure``, in the Query page of the CDAP Console:

	 In the CDAP Console:

	 #. Click the *Query* button.
	 #. Click on the *RanksProcedure* Procedure.
	 #. Type ``rank`` in the *Method* text box.
	 #. Type the parameters required for this method, a JSON string with the name *url* and
	    value of a URI, ``"http://example.com/page1"``:

	   ::

            { "url" : "http://example.com/page1" }

	 #. Click the *Execute* button.
	 #. The rank for that URL will be displayed in the Console in JSON format.
	    For example:

	   ::

            "0.9988696312751688"

Once done, you can stop the application as described in :ref:`Building and Running Applications <stop-application>`.
