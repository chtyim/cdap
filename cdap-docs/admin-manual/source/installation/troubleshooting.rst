Troubleshooting
===============

- If you have YARN configured to use LinuxContainerExecutor (see the setting for
  ``yarn.nodemanager.container-executor.class``), the ``cdap`` user needs to be present on
  all Hadoop nodes.

- If you are using a LinuxContainerExecutor, and the UID for the ``cdap`` user is less than
  500, you will need to add the ``cdap`` user to the allowed users configuration for the
  LinuxContainerExecutor in Yarn by editing the ``/etc/hadoop/conf/container-executor.cfg``
  file. Change the line for ``allowed.system.users`` to::

    allowed.system.users=cdap
