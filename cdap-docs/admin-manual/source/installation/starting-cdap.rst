Starting CDAP
=============

.. Note: this file is included in quick-start.rst; check any edits in this file with it!

This manual is to help you start up the Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP). It provides
the instructions for `startup <#configuration>`__ and `verification <#verification>`__ of
the CDAP components so they work with your existing Hadoop cluster.

It's assumed that you have already followed the :ref:`installation <installing-cdap>` and
:ref:`configuration <configuration>` steps.

.. _configuration-starting-services:

.. highlight:: console

Starting Services
-----------------
When all the packages and dependencies have been installed, and the configuration
parameters set, you can start the services on each of the CDAP boxes by running the
command::

  $ for i in `ls /etc/init.d/ | grep cdap` ; do sudo service $i restart ; done

When all the services have completed starting, the CDAP UI should then be
accessible through a browser at port ``9999``. 

The URL will be ``http://<host>:9999`` where ``<host>`` is the IP address of
one of the machines where you installed the packages and started the services.

.. _configuration-highly-available:

Making CDAP Highly-available
---------------------------------
Repeat these steps on additional boxes.  The configurations needed to support high-availability are:

- ``kafka.seed.brokers``: ``127.0.0.1:9092,...`` 
  
  - Kafka brokers list (comma separated)
  
- ``kafka.default.replication.factor``: 2

  - Used to replicate Kafka messages across multiple machines to prevent data loss in 
    the event of a hardware failure.
  - The recommended setting is to run at least two Kafka servers.
  - Set this to the number of Kafka servers.

Getting a Health Check

.. _configuration-verification:

Verification
------------
To verify that the CDAP software is successfully installed and you are able to use your
Hadoop cluster, run an example application.
We provide in our SDK pre-built ``.JAR`` files for convenience.

#. Download and install the latest `CDAP Software Development Kit (SDK)
   <http://cask.co/downloads/#cdap>`__.
#. Extract to a folder (``CDAP_HOME``).
#. Open a command prompt and navigate to ``CDAP_HOME/examples``.
#. Each example folder has a ``.jar`` file in its ``target`` directory.
   For verification, we will use the ``WordCount`` example.
#. Open a web browser to the CDAP UI.
   It is located on port ``9999`` of the box where you installed CDAP.
#. On the UI, click the button *Add App*.
#. Find the pre-built ``WordCount-``\ |literal-release|\ ``.jar`` using the dialog box to navigate to
   ``CDAP_HOME/examples/WordCount/target/``. 
#. Once the application is deployed, instructions on running the example can be found at the
   :ref:`WordCount example. <examples-word-count>`
#. You should be able to start the application, inject sentences, and retrieve results.
#. When finished, you can stop and remove the application as described in the section on
   :ref:`cdap-building-running`.
