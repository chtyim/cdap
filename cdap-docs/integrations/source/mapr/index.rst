Configuring and Installing CDAP on MapR
=======================================

.. highlight:: console

This section will assist you with installing CDAP on `MapR <https://www.mapr.com>`__. CDAP
can be installed on a MapR cluster by following the :ref:`manual instructions for installing
CDAP <installing-cdap>`. These notes are an addition to those steps.

As described in the :ref:`Software Prerequisites <install-software-requirements>`, 
a configured Hadoop and HBase (plus an optional Hive client) needs to be configured
on the node(s) where CDAP will run.

If colocating CDAP on cluster hosts with actual services, such as the MapR CLDB, Yarn
ResourceManager, or HBase Master, then the client configurations will already be in place.
Note that Gateways are redundant if colocating CDAP on cluster hosts with actual services,
such as the HBase Master, Yarn Resourcemanager, or HDFS Namenode.

- To configure a MapR client, see the MapR documentation on `Setting Up the Client
  <http://doc.mapr.com/display/MapR/Setting+Up+the+Client>`__.

- To configure a MapR HBase client, see the MapR documentation on `Installing HBase on a Client
  <http://doc.mapr.com/display/MapR/Installing+HBase#InstallingHBase-HBaseonaClientInstallingHBaseonaClient>`__.

- To configure a MapR Hive client, see the MapR documentation on `Installing Hive
  <http://doc.mapr.com/display/MapR/Installing+Hive>`__.

A typical client node should have the ``mapr-client``, ``mapr-hbase``, and ``mapr-hive`` packages installed, and can
be configured using the MapR `configure.sh <http://doc.mapr.com/display/MapR/configure.sh>`__ utility.

As in all installations, the ``kafka.log.dir`` may need to be created locally.

MapR does not provide a configured ``yarn.application.classpath`` by default. CDAP requires that an additional
entry |---| ``/opt/mapr/lib/*`` |---| be appended to the ``yarn.application.classpath`` setting in ``yarn-site.xml``.
The default ``yarn.application.classpath`` for Linux with this additional entry appended is (reformatted to fit)::

  $HADOOP_CONF_DIR, 
  $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/share/hadoop/common/*, 
  $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/share/hadoop/common/lib/*, 
  $HADOOP_HDFS_HOME/share/hadoop/hdfs/*, 
  $HADOOP_HDFS_HOME/share/hadoop/hdfs/lib/*, 
  $HADOOP_YARN_HOME/share/hadoop/yarn/*, 
  $HADOOP_YARN_HOME/share/hadoop/yarn/lib/*, 
  $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/*, 
  $HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/*, 
  /opt/mapr/lib/*

**Note:** Since MapR might not dereference the Hadoop variables (such as
``$HADOOP_CONF_DIR``) correctly, we recommend specifying their full paths instead.
